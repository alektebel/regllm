The EBA issued a short data request to these institutions, to assess the current application of \nthe 180 DPD criterion in terms of REA and exposure at default (EAD), its current and expected \nparameter estimates, i.e. probability of default (PD), LGD ( loss given default ), LGD in -default, \nexpected loss best estimate (EL BE), under the hypothetical scenario of a removal of the 180 DPD \ncriterion, and the current and expected credit risk adjustments and internal ratings -based \napproach ( IRB) shortfall or excess. Based on this information, only a number of institutions in \nthe UK and an institution in France make use of the 180 DPD exemption for material exposures . \n3. Given that currently only a limited number of institutions still make use of the 180 DPD \ncriterion, it is fair to say that use of the 180 DPD criterion is rare in the EU. Several jurisdictions \nwhere the 180 DPD criterion was allowed in the past have already ret urned to the 90 DPD \ncriterion.

This report is related to the work on the definition of default (DoD), in particular the recent \nregulatory technical standards (RTS) on materiality threshold and the Guidelines (GL) on DoD . \nArticle 178(1) CRR specifies that a default shall be considered to have occurred when either or \nboth: \na) the institution considers that the obligor is unlikely to pay; \nb) the obligor is more than 90 DPD on any material credit obligation to the institution, the \nparent undertak ing or any of its subsidiaries. \n10. Further , in Article 178(1)(b) CRR, national discretion to replace the 90 DPD criterion with \n180 DPD is specified: \n‘Competent authorities may replace the 90 days with 180 days for exposures secured by \nresidential or small a nd medium -sized enterprises (SME ) commercial real estate in the retail \nexposure class, as well as exposures to public sector entities.

Since Article 178(1) CRR excludes exposures in default under the Standardised Approach (SA) \nfrom the application of 180 DPD at national discretion, the scope of this report will focus only \non the IRB approach. \n13.

In Ireland, the CA allowed the use of the 180 DPD exemption only in a ‘passive’ sense, meaning \nthat the CA allowed institutions to choose (at consolidated level) to apply 90 days or the specific \nnumber of days set by the local CA, for exposures to counterparties located in other Member \nStates. \n17. In Port ugal, the 180 DPD criterion was allowed by Banco de Portugal Notice ( ‘Aviso 5/2007 ’), \nParagraph 45, Part IV, which entered into force on 27 April 2007. However, none of the \ninstitutions in Portugal made use of the exemption, which is also why it was abolis hed at the \nstart of the entry into force of the CRR.

To fulfil the EBA mandate \nwhil e minimi sing the operational burden for your institution, the EBA has issued a data request \nfor all relevant exposure classes (see Annex I for an example ) to th ose institutions which \ncurrently still make use of the 180 DPD criterion. The EBA has applied the definit ions and \nformulas explained in Annex III to the data submitted , to analyse the impact of the 180 DPD \nprovision. \n30. Detailed information has been requested on exposures that are currently treated in models \nwhere the 180 DPD provision is applied. In line with Article 78(1)(b) CRR, the stipulation to \nallow the 180 DPD provision may apply to RRE or SME CRE exposures in the retail exposure \nclass , as well as exposures to PSEs. For each of these, a data request was included in a separate \nsheet.10 \n31. Accordingly , the as sessment perimeter consists of exposures that are currently assigned to \nmodels where a 180 DPD provision is applied in the DoD . The impact of the hypothetical \nscenario of removing the 180 DPD provision has been analysed. The quantitative analysis takes \ninto consideration the main effects that would derive from replacing the 180 DPD provision \nwith the 90 DPD provision, i.e. a reallocation of exposures that are currently non -defaulted \nexposures to defaulted exposures , and the expec ted change in risk parameters. \na.

On \naverage, this proportion amounts to 24.39%, but significant variation exists across the \ninstitutions. \n50. Table 2 shows how the risk parameters and CRA would be affected under the hypothetical \nscenario of a removal of the 180 DPD exemption. The PD estimate on the non -defaulted \nexposures is expected to increase on average by 4 3.52 % after a removal of the 180 DPD \nexemption. However, a wide variation can be observed, ranging from 0 % to 116.07 %. For the \nLGD estimate, the results show either a decrease or no effect at all, which confirms our \nexpectations (see paragraph 35). It should be mentioned that this may be due to the constraint \nof the 10 % LGD floor (Article 164(4) CRR). This means in particular that without the LGD floo r \nthe impact on REA would have been smaller, since the increase in the PD estimate would have \nbeen compensated for by a greater decrease in the LGD estimate. \n51. The interplay of the higher increase in PD than the decrease in the LGD and the portfolio \nrealloc ation leads to an increase in the EL amount for most institutions. A decrease in the LGD \nin-default and the ELBE estimate is reported on average. \n52. A decrease or no change in the amount of CRA for non -defaulted exposures is expected for all \ninstitutions.

Several jurisdictions where the 180 DPD exemption \nwas allowed in the past have already returned to the 90 DPD criterion in all institutions. \nFurthermore, the SSM issued a regulation (for its SIs) and GL (for its LSIs) allowing only the \n90 DPD criterion. \n60. Analysis of the data submitted by the institutions that still make use of the 180 DPD criterion \nshow s that a removal of the 180 DPD criterion would lead to an increase in REA in two thirds \nof the institutions. These increases in REA can be explained mostly by the f act that the increase \nin PD has a greater (upward) effect than the decrease in LGD on reducing the REA. The average \nexpected relative change in REA is 1.61 %. However , a wide variation in these numbers can be \nobserved, reaching a maximum of 23.57 % and a min imum of −20.30 % (relative changes in RW). \n61. For some institutions, the decrease in the LGD parameter was constrained by the 10 % floor on \nretail exposures secured by RRE (Article 164(4) CRR). Without this floor, the increase in REA \nwould naturally have been smaller, since the increase in the PD would have been \ncounterbalanced by a larger decrease in the LGD estimate. \n62. On average, a decrease in own funds of 0.44 % can be expected, which is driven by the change \nin the shortfall (i.e. a larger shortfall to be dedu cted from Tier 1 capital). The decrease in the \nown funds further aggravates the effect on the capital ratio. \n63. A decrease in the capital ratio can be observed in several institutions.

Sólo cuando la acción de los responsables públicos se somete a escrutinio, cuando los ciudadanos pueden conocer cómo se toman las decisiones que les afectan, cómo se manejan los fondos públicos o bajo qué criterios actúan nuestras instituciones podremos hablar del inicio de un proceso en el que los poderes públicos comienzan a responder a una sociedad que es crítica, exigente y que demanda participación de los poderes públicos.\nLos países con mayores niveles en materia de transparencia y normas de buen gobierno cuentan con instituciones más fuertes, que favorecen el crecimiento económico y el desarrollo social. En estos países, los ciudadanos pueden juzgar mejor y con más criterio la capacidad de sus responsables públicos y decidir en consecuencia. Permitiendo una mejor fiscalización de la actividad pública se contribuye a la necesaria regeneración democrática, se promueve la eficiencia y eficacia del Estado y se favorece el crecimiento económico.\nLa presente Ley tiene un triple alcance: incrementa y refuerza la transparencia en la actividad pública –que se articula a través de obligaciones de publicidad activa para todas las Administraciones y entidades públicas–, reco",

En él se ex plica el enfoque que \nseguirá el MUS en sus tareas de supervisión. El MUS está facultado para apartarse de la política general establecida en este manual si está justificado por \ncircunstancias con cretas y lo fundamenta debidamente. La adopción de políticas \ndivergentes también ha de ser compatible con los principios generales del Derecho de la UE, en particular los de igualdad de trato, proporcionalidad y expectativas legítimas de las entidades supervisadas. Esto es coherente con la jurisprudencia \nconsolidada del Tribunal de Justicia de la Unión Europea, en la que las directrices \ninternas, como este manual, se definen como prácticas de actuación de las que las \ninstituciones de la UE pueden apartarse en casos justificados. Por ejemplo, el \napartado 209 de la sentencia del Tribunal de Justicia de 28 de junio de 2005 en los \nasuntos acumulados C -189/02, C -202/02, C -205/02 a C -208/02 y C -213/02 \nestablece que: «Pronunciándose sobre unas medidas internas adoptadas por la \nadministración, el Tribunal de Justicia ha declarado ya que, si bien éstas no pueden calificarse de norma jurídica a cuya observancia está obligada en cualquier caso la administración, establecen sin embargo una regla de conducta indicativa de la \npráctica que debe seguirse y de la cual la administración no puede apartarse, en un \ndeterminado caso, sin dar razones que sean compatibles con el principio de igualdad de trato. Por consiguiente, dichas medidas constituyen un acto de carácter \ngeneral cuya ilegalidad pueden invocar los funcionarios y agentes afectados en \napoyo de un recurso interpuesto contra decisiones individuales adoptadas con \narreglo a las mismas».",

En el contexto de los planes de reestructuración, el BCE puede requerir a una entidad \nsupervisada la presentación de un nuevo plan de reestructuración en un breve plazo \nde hasta tres meses si aprecia deficiencias importantes o impedimentos para la ejecución del plan. Si el nuevo plan no subsana dichas deficiencias o impedimentos, \nel BCE puede exigir a la entidad la realización de cambios concretos en el plan. Si \nlos cambios no subsanan adecuadamente las deficiencias o impedimentos, el BCE puede solicitar a la entidad que identifique qué cambios podría introducir en su actividad para aumentar su capacidad de recuperación frente a situaciones de crisis. \nEn el marco de la supervisión continuada, el ECS hace un seguimiento continuado de la situación de la entidad supervisada, teniendo en cuenta el principio de proporcionalidad y comprobando si la situación financiera de la entidad empeora \nsustancialmente al pasar de una situación de normalidad a una situación de crisis. \nLa División de Gestión de Crisis proporciona apoyo de expertos a los ECS en la evaluación de los planes de reestructuración y en las actuaciones de seguimiento; \npor ejemplo, elaborando guías sobre temas horizontales, garantizando una \nrespuesta coherente a las entidades y realizando análisis comparativos \n(benchmarking) .",
